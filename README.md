Hey Chris;

Not sure if you'll look at the readme, but here is the logic behind my design:

I wanted to take a goofy story and craft a simple, traditional turn-based RPG around that, within the realm of the 
project. Hopefully, you find it fun. Instead of balancing the game toward punishing, there are a decent amount of story 
parts, so I didn't want this to take forever. Instead, I erred towards too easy, since this project is about showing 
mechanics rather than a game you can play for weeks. 

Hopefully I've done that here. Have fun!
