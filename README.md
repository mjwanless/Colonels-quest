### Here some 

Hey Chris;

Not sure if you'll look at the readme, but here is the logic behind my design:

I wanted to take a goofy story and craft a simple, traditional turn-based RPG around that, within the realm of the 
project. Hopefully, you find it fun. Instead of balancing the game toward punishing, there are a decent amount of story 
parts, so I didn't want this to take forever. Instead, I erred towards too easy, since this project is about showing 
mechanics rather than a game you can play for weeks. 

Hopefully I've done that here. Have fun!

(I assume that the below is what you mean when you ask for "README.md contains required
information in tabular form.")
