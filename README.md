## Developer:

Hello! I'm Malcolm Wanless, and this is my Python-coded, text-based adventure game. I developed it as part of an end-of-term project over the course of a couple of weeks.

# User Guide 
## How to Run

- Clone with `git clone`
- Run `python game.py` to start the game.
- Navigate through locations using number-based inputs (1, 2, 3, 4); The directions are stated on the command line.
- Encounter variations of chickens and roosters and engage in combat.
- Level up by gaining experience points (Exp).
- Keep going until you're able to reach Colonel Sanders in his chambers. If you can defeat him, you win.

## Combat

This game uses a combat system not dissimilar to a DnD-style D20/3.5 number generation for things such as pseudo-random values and damage.
Both the player and enemies use the same kind of system to generate damage and healing.
Healing and regeneration occur during and after the combat rounds.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer

## Takeaways

I really enjoyed working on this project. While it was a lot of work to do alongside the other five classes that I had that semester (including a full-stack web dev course), I found myself wanting to continue to add more levels and features as I went. Some of the things that I would like to add eventually are:
- A wider variety of enemies
- More spells
- Better combat balance
- More maps
- A GUI interface

This was also a great project for practicing unit testing and exception handling; Developing for testing made me appreciate the kind of detail that is needed to build more robust programs.

**Thanks for checking this out!**
