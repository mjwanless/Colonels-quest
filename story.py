	In the quaint town of Eldermere, nestled between rolling hills and ancient forests, a mage named Elyndor strolled along a path that wound through the heart of the mystical Enchanted Woods. 
	Elyndor was known far and wide for his expertise in arcane arts and his insatiable curiosity for uncovering hidden secrets. 
	On this particular day, an unusual aura tinged the air, prompting the mage to follow an invisible trail that beckoned him deeper into the woods.

	As Elyndor ventured further, the foliage grew thicker, and the sunlight filtered through the leaves in a dance of shadows. 
	He sensed an unusual energy resonating in the air, a subtle vibration that set his magical senses tingling. 
	Guided by an unseen force, the mage stumbled upon an ancient door, concealed behind ivy-covered vines and mossy rocks.

	Intrigued by the mysterious atmosphere, Elyndor hesitated only briefly before uttering an incantation to unlock the hidden portal. 
	The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit passage leading into the depths of the earth. Encouraged by his new 
	discovery, the mage descended, his steps echoing through the narrow corridor.

	As he navigated the twisting tunnels, Elyndor's senses heightened, detecting a faint aroma that wafted through the air. 
	The scent was a tantalizing blend of herbs, spices, and a hint of something fried. The mage's curiosity grew, 
	and he quickened his pace, drawn by the inexplicable allure of the treasures within.

	Emerging into a vast underground chamber, Elyndor's eyes widened in astonishment. 
	Before him lay a cavernous space adorned with magical symbols and ornate tapestries, illuminated by enchanted flames that danced in blue and gold hues. 
	At the heart of the chamber stood a figure, clad in robes adorned with an array of medals and a distinctive white beard.

	To Elyndor's amazement, the figure turned to reveal the unmistakable countenance of Colonel Sanders, the legendary fried chicken magnate. 
	The air crackled with an unexpected blend of magic and the savory aroma of fried delights, creating an atmosphere that defied all logic.

	"Welcome, esteemed mage," Colonel Sanders greeted with a twinkle in his eye. 
	"I've been waiting for someone with the gift of magic to discover my hidden sanctuary. Would you care for a taste of my magical recipes, crafted with a touch of enchantment?"

	Elyndor regarded Colonel Sanders with a mix of awe and suspicion. 
	The alluring aroma of fried enchantment beckoned, but the mage sensed an underlying magic that hinted at a more significant mystery.
	"I appreciate the offer, Colonel," Elyndor said cautiously, "but I must know the purpose of this hidden lair and its connection to the magical energies I felt outside."
	""")

	Colonel Sanders chuckled, his eyes gleaming with a mischievous twinkle. "Ah, a mage of discernment! 
	You see, Elyndor, I've discovered a way to infuse my secret herbs and spices with magical properties, creating a taste that transcends the ordinary. 
	But to reveal the full extent of my culinary sorcery, you must prove your worth."
	""")
	# time.sleep(1)
	print(f"""
	"Make your way to me, and fight through my defenses, and I may yet share my secrets with you."
	Colonel Sanders, still chuckling, gestured towards a concealed door at the far end of the cavernous chamber. 
	"To truly understand the magic within my recipes, you must make it to my culinary sanctum. Fight through my 
	guardians, Elyndor, and find me, to truly be tested."
	""")
# 	time.sleep(1)

	And with that, Sanders vanished in a cloud of aromatic smoke. Elyndor grabbed his staff and looked around. The 
	building seemed to be three large rooms, separated by two magic barriers and a final door to the sanctum. A 
	glowing coop surrounded the room, full of legions of hens.
	""")
# 	time.sleep(1)
	print(f"""
    The hens, their feathers shimmering in hues not found in the natural world, regarded Elyndor with keen, intelligent eyes.
    "These are no ordinary hens, my friend," Colonel Sanders voice boomed out, from everywhere at once. "They are 
    infused with magical energies, and their clucks resonate with protective spells. Should anyone pose a threat to 
    the sanctity of my culinary arts, they shall defend it with all their feathery might."

	Elyndor observed the guardian hens, noting the mystical auras that surrounded them. "Are they to be my opponents, then? In a battle to prove my worth?"
	Colonel Sanders nodded, a twinkle returning to his eyes. 
	"Indeed. If you wish to grasp the full flavor of my culinary sorcery, you must first pass the challenge laid forth by my guardian hens. 
	Fear not, for their magic is both a test and a testament to the harmony between the arcane and the culinary arts."

	print(f""" 
	'With a wave of his hand, Colonel Sanders released the guardian hens from their coop, and they circled around the mage.
	Feathers aglow with magical radiance, the hens clucked in unison, ready to defend the secrets held within the enchanted kitchen.
	Elyndor, staff at the ready, prepared for the unexpected clash between his magical prowess and the mystical guardians. 
	The air crackled with anticipation as the mage and the guardian hens faced each other, 
	marking the beginning of a culinary duel that would determine the fate of the magical balance they all sought to preserve.
